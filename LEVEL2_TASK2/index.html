            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>Albert Einstein, (born March 14, 1879, Ulm, Württemberg, Germany—died April 18, 1955, Princeton, New
                Jersey, U.S.), German-born physicist who developed the special and general theories of relativity and
                won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. Einstein is
                generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century.</p>

            <div class="bio">
                <div>
                    <h4>Childhood and Education</h4>
                    <p>Einstein’s parents were secular, middle-class Jews. His father, Hermann Einstein, was originally
                        a featherbed salesman and later ran an electrochemical factory with moderate success. His
                        mother, the former Pauline Koch, ran the family household. He had one sister, Maria (who went by
                        the name Maja), born two years after Albert. <br><br>

                        Einstein would write that two “wonders” deeply affected his early years. The first was his
                        encounter with a compass at age five. He was mystified that invisible forces could deflect the
                        needle. This would lead to a lifelong fascination with invisible forces. The second wonder came
                        at age 12 when he discovered a book of geometry, which he devoured, calling it his “sacred
                        little geometry book.”
                        <br><br>

                        Einstein became deeply religious at age 12, even composing several songs in praise of God and
                        chanting religious songs on the way to school. This began to change, however, after he read
                        science books that contradicted his religious beliefs. This challenge to established authority
                        left a deep and lasting impression. At the Luitpold Gymnasium, Einstein often felt out of place
                        and victimized by a Prussian-style educational system that seemed to stifle originality and
                        creativity. One teacher even told him that he would never amount to anything.
                        <br><br>

                        Yet another important influence on Einstein was a young medical student, Max Talmud (later Max
                        Talmey), who often had dinner at the Einstein home. Talmud became an informal tutor, introducing
                        Einstein to higher mathematics and philosophy. A pivotal turning point occurred when Einstein
                        was 16 years old. Talmud had earlier introduced him to a children’s science series by Aaron
                        Bernstein, Naturwissenschaftliche Volksbucher (1867–68; Popular Books on Physical Science), in
                        which the author imagined riding alongside electricity that was traveling inside a telegraph
                        wire. Einstein then asked himself the question that would dominate his thinking for the next 10
                        years: What would a light beam look like if you could run alongside it? If light were a wave,
                        then the light beam should appear stationary, like a frozen wave. Even as a child, though, he
                        knew that stationary light waves had never been seen, so there was a paradox. Einstein also
                        wrote his first “scientific paper” at that time (“The Investigation of the State of Aether in
                        Magnetic Fields”).

                    <h4>From graduation to the “miracle year” of scientific theories of Albert Einstein</h4>
                    <p>After graduation in 1900, Einstein faced one of the greatest crises in his life. Because he
                        studied advanced subjects on his own, he often cut classes; this earned him the animosity of
                        some professors, especially Heinrich Weber. Unfortunately, Einstein asked Weber for a letter of
                        recommendation. Einstein was subsequently turned down for every academic position that he
                        applied to. He later wrote,
                        <br><br>
                        "I would have found [a job] long ago if Weber had not played a dishonest game with me."
                        <br><br>

                        Meanwhile, Einstein’s relationship with Maric deepened, but his parents vehemently opposed the
                        relationship. His mother especially objected to her Serbian background (Maric’s family was
                        Eastern Orthodox Christian). Einstein defied his parents, however, and in January 1902 he and
                        Maric even had a child, Lieserl, whose fate is unknown. (It is commonly thought that she died of
                        scarlet fever or was given up for adoption.)
                        <br><br>
                        In 1902 Einstein reached perhaps the lowest point in his life. He could not marry Maric and
                        support a family without a job, and his father’s business went bankrupt. Desperate and
                        unemployed, Einstein took lowly jobs tutoring children, but he was fired from even these jobs.
                        <br><br>
                        The turning point came later that year, when the father of his lifelong friend Marcel Grossmann
                        was able to recommend him for a position as a clerk in the Swiss patent office in Bern. About
                        then, Einstein’s father became seriously ill and, just before he died, gave his blessing for his
                        son to marry Maric. For years, Einstein would experience enormous sadness remembering that his
                        father had died thinking him a failure.
                        <br><br>
                        With a small but steady income for the first time, Einstein felt confident enough to marry
                        Maric, which he did on January 6, 1903. Their children, Hans Albert and Eduard, were born in
                        Bern in 1904 and 1910, respectively. In hindsight, Einstein’s job at the patent office was a
                        blessing. He would quickly finish analyzing patent applications, leaving him time to daydream
                        about the vision that had obsessed him since he was 16: What would happen if you raced alongside
                        a light beam? While at the polytechnic school he had studied Maxwell’s equations, which describe
                        the nature of light, and discovered a fact unknown to James Clerk Maxwell himself—namely, that
                        the speed of light remains the same no matter how fast one moves. This violates Newton’s laws of
                        motion, however, because there is no absolute velocity in Isaac Newton’s theory. This insight
                        led Einstein to formulate the principle of relativity: “the speed of light is a constant in any
                        inertial frame (constantly moving frame).”

                    <h4>The final days of Albert Einstein</h4>
                    <p>Albert Einstein’s time on earth ended on April 18, 1955, at the Princeton Hospital. In April of
                        1955, shortly after Einstein’s death, a pathologist removed his brain without the permission of
                        his family, and stored it in formaldehyde until around 2007, shortly before dying himself. In
                        that time, the brain of the man who has been credited with the some of the most beautiful and
                        imaginative ideas in all of science was photographed, fragmented—small sections parceled to
                        various researchers. His eyes were given to his ophthalmologist. These indignities in the name
                        of science netted several so-called findings—that the inferior parietal lobe, the part said to
                        be responsible for mathematical reasoning was wider, that the unique makeup of the Sulvian
                        fissure could have allowed more neurons to make connections. And yet, there remains the sense
                        that no differences can truly account for the cognitive abilities that made his genius so
                        striking.
                        <br><br>
                        One might expect a story of encroaching death, however restrained, to chronicle confusion and
                        fear. Medically supported death was a regular occurrence by the middle of the 20th century, and
                        Einstein died in his local hospital. But what is immediately striking from the account is the
                        simplicity and calmness with which Einstein met his own passing, which he regarded as a natural
                        event. The telling of this chapter is matter of fact, from his collapse at home, to his
                        diagnosis with a hemorrhage, to his reluctant trip to the hospital and refusal of a famous heart
                        surgeon. Dukas writes that he endured the pain from an internal hemorrhage (“the worst pain one
                        can have”) with a smile, occasionally taking morphine. On his final day, during a respite from
                        pain, he read the paper and talked about politics and scientific matters. “You’re really
                        hysterical—I have to pass on sometime, and it doesn’t really matter when.” he tells Dukas, when
                        she rises in the night to check on him.
